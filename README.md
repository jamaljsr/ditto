## Purpose

Polar was built to help Lightning Network application developers quickly spin up one or more networks locally on their computers.

With Polar you can:

- Create a regtest Lightning Network in just a few clicks
- Connect from your app to the lightning nodes via RPC
- Launch a terminal in each bitcoin/lightning node
- Add more nodes using drag & drop
- Open & Close Channels
- Manually mine new blocks
- Deposit regtest coins into each Lightning node

Supported Network Nodes:

- LND v0.8.0 & v0.7.1
- Bitcoin Core v0.18.1
- c-lightning (coming soon)
- eclair (coming soon)

## Dependencies

Polar requires that you have Docker installed to create the local networks

- On Mac & Windows, you can just install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- On Linux, you need to install [Docker Server](https://docs.docker.com/install/#server) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) separately

## Download

The most current Polar downloads for Mac, Windows & Linux can be found in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/releases)

## Polar's Future

The overall goal of Polar is to minimize the time & effort needed for a developer new to Lightning to get started building their next killer app. In addition, Polar aims to be a useful tool for experienced Lightning App developers to iterate faster on their projects. Less time setting up nodes, more time building your app.

Here's a short list of ideas for features that may be beneficial to add in future releases (in no particular order):

- Network snapshots with the ability to import/export them. These could also be used as templates to quickly boot up a network with predefined nodes and channels. The templates could be hosted github to allow community contributions. This may require a scripting system built-in.
- Sample app projects/code in different languages (Python, Typescript/JS, Go, C#) showing how to connect to the Lightning/Bitcoin nodes from an external app.
- Bitcoin Block Explorer & GRPC/REST API Explorers to have access to all of the node RPC API's graphically, without needing to fallback to the Terminal.
- A branded website with download links and getting started guides to make Polar a bit easier to find via search engines

## Help Translate

Polar's translations are managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/polar). The initial translations of 10 languages were done by machine (Google Translate) and are likely to not be 100% accurate. If you speak multiple languages and wish to help with translations, please feel free to head over to the [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/polar) on Crowdin and submit updated strings. This assistance would be greatly appreciated.
