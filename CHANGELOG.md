# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2019-12-21)

This released was focused on adding features that didn't make it in the first release, as well as some stability improvements. There are new and updated node versions as well as many more language translations included. Languages can now be crowd-sourced via Crowdin. See the [README](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar#help-translate) for more details.

In the next release, I plan on tackling some of the great feature requests submitted since the initial launch. If you have any suggestions or use-cases you'd like to see improved with Polar, please don't hesitate to open an issue.

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

With c-lighting changing the folder structure of their dataDir in v0.8.0, lightningd was unable to create the lightning-rpc socket file due to 'path too long' errors on Mac. Polar previously stored the data for nodes in ~/Library/Application Support/polar/data/networks/. This has now been changed to ~/.polar on all OS's. Due to this change, networks that were created in Polar v0.1.0 will no longer be displayed in the app. They will need to be mnually moved or re-created.

To move the previous networks to the new location, you must stop any running networks and close the Polar app. Then move the 'networks' folder depending on your OS to the new location:

Location in v0.1.0

- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/polar/data/networks/`
- Linux: `~/config/polar/data/networks/`
- Windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/polar/data/networks/`

New location in v0.2.0

- All OS's: `~/.polar/networks/`
